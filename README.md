# 📝 React Blog App (Appwrite)

A full-featured blog application built using **React**, **Redux**, and **Appwrite**.  
Users can create, edit, delete posts, upload featured images, and view posts with rich content.

This project helped me learn real-world concepts like:
- Authentication & Authorization
- File upload & preview
- CRUD operations with a backend (Appwrite)
- State management with Redux
- Form handling with react-hook-form
- Debugging real production-like issues 😄
